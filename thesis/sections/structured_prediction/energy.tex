A basis of both inference and parameter training is a proper formulation of an energy function, which reflects a probability of occurrence of a given configuration of variables in a system. In semantic image segmentation, without correctly defined energy function it will not be possible to differentiate objects of different classes. As it has already been presented, energy is composed of two terms: unary potential and pairwise potential.
