The first goal of the thesis was to perform theoretical research on the different algorithms that may be useful for semantic image segmentation with the use of Conditional Random Fields. After a thorough analysis of those algorithms, it was necessary to choose such that may be applicable for the dataset used in this thesis and at the same time will not require excessive computational resources. The second main goal was to create a system that will perform a semantic segmentation of the chosen images. This required implementing of the selected algorithms and checking which ones are in fact capable of fulfilling the topic of this thesis and which would require too many resources. Another objective was to test the performance of the system and adjust the details and parameters of the developed algorithms in order to increase the precision of the semantic segmentation.
