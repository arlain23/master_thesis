The first goal of the thesis was to perform a theoretical research on the different algorithms that may be used for semantic image segmentation with use of Conditional Random Fields. After a deep analysis of those algorithms it was necessary to choose such that may be applicable for the dataset used in this thesis and at the same time will not require excessive computational resources. The second main goal was to create a system that will perform a semantic segmentation of the chosen images. This required implementing of the selected algorithms and checking which ones are in fact capable of fulfilling the topic of this thesis. Another objective was to test the performance of the system and adjust the details of algorithms in order to increase the precision of the semantic segmentation.
