As the main goal of the thesis is to perform semantic segmentation of images, this chapter will be focused on providing an explanation of this task and presenting methods that can be used to achieve it. 

In order to present the concept of semantic image segmentation, there is a need to define a more general term, which is image segmentation \cite{digital_image_processing}. It is a process aimed to divide an image into regions sharing similar properties, which usually means finding distinct objects and boundaries between them. Depending on an application those partitions will differ, as the goal is to identify regions that provide relevant data for a given problem and this relevance may differ in various applications.  Segmentation is often conducted at the preprocessing stage of image analysis, which by grouping pixels into larger regions makes further analysis much simpler and less costly in terms of computations. 
There are many techniques to tackle the problem of segmentation, however, most of them can be described by one of three categories: threshold, edge-based and region-based methods \cite{Glasbey_segmentation}. Thresholding is the simplest approach to image segmentation in which individual pixels are assigned to a certain region depending on whether their intensity is in a range of intensities of this region. Edge-based methods are aimed to detect pixels that can be identified as edges between objects, which are characterised by a noticeable change in intensity between neighbouring regions. With all edges detected, it is possible to specify boundaries between objects giving a full segmentation of an image. The last set of techniques, which are region-based methods are aimed to group pixels that have similar properties into sets named regions, which correspond to objects or parts of objects present on an image. This may be obtained by region splitting, which means dividing regions into subregions until all the pixels in a region are homogeneous.  An alternative is region growing, which joins neighbouring subregions, if they share similar properties, to obtain larger regions. Very often also a hybrid of these two algorithms is used. 
Those three methods are the most basic ones when it comes to simple segmentation tasks. Though, for more complicated tasks they are not applicable, they can be used or partially incorporated by more sophisticated algorithms.
