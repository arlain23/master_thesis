The aim of the second experiment of this part of the system was exactly the same as in the first one, which was to perform semantic segmentation on images containing objects differing only by shape. However, this time some noise was introduced to the process of colour quantisation of original images. A reason behind addition of noise was to simulate wrong assignment of regions to textons during the process of texton map creation from the original work of Jamie Shotton \cite{article_main}. The whole procedure of semantic image segmentation is the same as in case of noise-free images and the only difference lies in a generated dataset.
