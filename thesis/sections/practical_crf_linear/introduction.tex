The goal of this thesis was to create an image semantic segmentation system with the use of Conditional Random Fields. This chapter and chapter \textit{\ref{chapter:nonlinear} \nameref{chapter:nonlinear}} will be devoted to a detailed description on how the theoretical background that was already explained can be adapted to perform the task specified in this dissertation. First section of this chapter will an provide overview of the system in terms of the main goals of this part of the thesis and how they were achieved from an implementation point of view. Next two sections will provide a detailed description of procedures that were required to be performed before semantic image segmentation can take place and these are a preprocessing process and selection of a feature function. Then, a dataset used for training and testing of the solution will be presented. Last, but definitely not least, an overview of the conducted experiments and their results will be provided.
