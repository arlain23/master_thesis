The topic of this thesis concerned the task of semantic image segmentation with the use of Conditional Random Fields, which was described in details from the theoretical point of view in \textit{chapter \ref{chapter:structured_prediction}: \nameref{chapter:structured_prediction}}. In order to state whether the explained algorithms are capable of performing the main task of this thesis, there was a need to implement them. Therefore, an image segmentation system was developed, which incorporates the previously described methods. In this chapter, basic information about the capabilities of the system, its components and the technological stack will be presented.
