The topic of this thesis concerned the task of semantic image segmentation with use of Conditional Random Fields. This problem was described in details from the theoretical point of view in \textit{chapter \ref{chapter:structured_prediction}: \nameref{chapter:structured_prediction}}. The algorithms that were explained in this chapter were implemented in order to test in practice whether they are capable of performing the main task of this thesis. Therefore, an image segmentation system was created that incorporates the previously described methods. In this chapter a very basic information about capabilities of the system, its components and technological stack will be presented.
